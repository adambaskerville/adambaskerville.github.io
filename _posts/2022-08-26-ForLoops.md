Click the following button to launch an ipython notebook on Google Colab which implements the code developed in this post:

**The Problem**

What is the easiest way to parallelize a for loop in Python?

**The Solution**

Using the `joblib` library. Consider the following, non-parallelized example where we generate a list of integers and calculate their factorials. There are better ways to do this using vectorised operations in `numpy` but this is just used as a demonstration.

```python
import time
import math


def compute_factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Compute a factorial of a provided integer

    Args:
        n (int): The integer to calculate the factorial of

    Returns:
        int: The calculated factorial
    """
    return math.factorial(n)

# list of numbers
numbers = [i for i in range(1, 100000)]

# measure time taken to compute factorials sequentially
start_time = time.time()
factorials_sequential = [compute_factorial(number) for number in numbers]
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Sequential computation took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Now we run the same function but this time we split the list into 'chunks', each of which is processed on a different CPU core in parallel to speed up their calculation using the `joblib` library.

```python
from joblib import Parallel, delayed, cpu_count

# measure time taken to compute factorials in parallel
start_time = time.time()
factorials_parallel = Parallel(n_jobs=cpu_count())(delayed(compute_factorial)(number) for number in numbers)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Parallel computation took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```
That's it! Bonus being that it is a one-liner too.

A description of the syntax for the parallel code is as follows:

1. `delayed`:
    * `delayed(compute_factorial)(number)` wraps the `compute_factorial` function call, marking it for delayed execution.
    * This means the function call and its argument (`number`) are not executed immediately but are instead prepared to be dispatched to a worker process or thread when `Parallel` runs.

2. `Parallel`:
    * `Parallel(n_jobs=cpu_count())` initializes a parallel computing environment with as many workers as there are CPU cores available (`n_jobs=cpu_count()`).
    * The list comprehension `[delayed(compute_factorial)(number) for number in numbers]` generates a list of delayed function calls.
    * Parallel takes this list of delayed calls and executes them in parallel, distributing the work across the available CPU cores.
    * The result is a list of computed factorials, executed in parallel.

On my MacBook the results are:

* Sequential = 81.4 seconds
* Parallel = 10.4 seconds

~ 8 times faster. There are seemingly a million ways to parallelize things in Python, some of which are not true parallelization as they are still bound by the global interpreter lock, GIL. I have always found `joblib` the easiest way to parallelise a `for` loop.
