Nearly everyone has had influential teachers throughout their school years. I can list several notable candidates, but truthfully the best teacher has always been the internet. It is something a lot of us take for granted, and seldom utilise to its fullest potential.

I aim to try and give back to the community, posting about scientific, mathematical and programming related problems that I encounter in my research and how I overcome them. This will hopefully lead to a post library which people can benefit from if they by chance stumble upon it. I want it to be a place to sip on new knowledge without the ingestion of cookie notifications and mind-numbing adverts. It will always be kept clean, simple and ad-free.

The name "Textbook to Terminal" or "T > T" for short is making a bad pun out of the bash redirection command `>`. There is often a large disconnect between published mathematics/science and how to program it effectively which hopefully I can help to address in these posts. If you have any ideas or methods you would like covered in a blog post feel free to message me.
