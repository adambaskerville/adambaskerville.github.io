I am currently a quantum physicist at kvantify. More broadly I am a quantum chemical physicist and scientific programmer who enjoys solving complex scientific and mathematical problems using computers.

In my spare time I enjoy powerlifting and strongman training, astrophotography, oil painting and tinkering with Raspberry Pi's.

## Work
2025-present: Quantum physicist, Kvantify, UK. 
2022-2025: Quantum mechanics research scientist, ExscientiaAI, UK. Applying quantum mechanics and machine learning to drug discovery, with a focus on predicting drug-like properties using neural network potentials (NNPs).
2018-2022: Postdoctoral research fellow, The University of Sussex, UK. Fundamental Studies of Electron Correlation with Applications to DFT.
