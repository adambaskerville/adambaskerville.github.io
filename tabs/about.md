I am a quantum chemical physicist and scientific programmer who enjoys solving complex scientific and mathematical problems using computers. Currently I write programs to understand how particles inside atoms and molecules interact using quantum theory.

<b>Areas of experience:</b>

* <b>3Body library:</b> Developed extensive library of high accuracy programs applicable to solving the Schrödinger equation for any three-particle system, exploring new quantum chemical physics using their wavefunctions.

* <b>Density-Energy Space:</b> Developed new physical framework showing a direct relationship between radial electron density and the total energy for quantum mechanical systems; a realisation of the Hohenberg and Kohn theorem.

* <b>Electron Correlation:</b> Calculated the current best electron correlation data for two-electron atoms through the Fully Correlated (FC) and Hartree Fock (HF) programs I developed in the 3Body library. I developed highly optimized, vectorized and parallelized C program to rapidly calculate millions of two-electron integrals using 200-digit precision with rigorous error bounds for each integral.

* <b>Density Functional Theory Investigation:</b> Implemented work of Colle and Salvetti (CS), Lee, Yang and Parr (LYP) and other DFT functionals to interface with my high accuracy FC and HF wavefunctions.

* <b>Weakly Bound and Excited States:</b> Implemented theoretical methodologies to analyse asymmetric behaviour of fermions in two-electron systems. I developed a deep learning inspired GPU technique using PyTorch to successfuly circumvent computational difficulties owing to ill-conditioned matrices.

I have expertise in greater than double precision calculations using DoubleDouble/QuadDouble data types as well as ball arithmetic; and parallel/GPU programming techniques using a variety of programming languages. I also routinely use machine learning in my research.

I run a blog called Textbook to Terminal, T>T, where I discuss scientific and mathematical related problems and how to program them (click the link on your left!)

In my spare time I enjoy powerlifting and strongman training, astrophotography, oil painting and tinkering with Raspberry Pi's.
