I am currently a quantum mechanics research scientist at Exscientia AI. More broadly I am a quantum chemical physicist and scientific programmer who enjoys solving complex scientific and mathematical problems using computers.

In my spare time I enjoy powerlifting and strongman training, astrophotography, oil painting and tinkering with Raspberry Pi's.
